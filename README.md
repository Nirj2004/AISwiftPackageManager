# AISWIFTPACKAGEMANAGER

## Installation 


### Manual ü§ì
 Copy Source files from this repository into your own project

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)üì±
 You can use this Swift Package Manager to integrate the library by adding the following dependency in your project's 'Package.swift' file or by adding directly within XCode
 
`.Package(url: "https://github.com/Nirj2004/AISWIFTPACKAGEMANAGER.git", majorVersion: 1)`


## Example Usage üòÄ

Import the module in your application.

`import AISWIFTPACKAGEMANAGER`


Set your API token from creating one [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).


`let openAI = AISWIFTPACKAGEMANAGER(authToken: "TOKEN")`


Create a call to the completions API, passing in a text prompt.


```swift
openAI.sendCompletion(with: "Hello how are you", maxTokens: 100) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    switch result {
        case .success(let success):
            print(success.choices.first?.text ?? "")
        case .failure(let failure):
            print(failure.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

The API will return an `OpenAPI` object conatining the corresponding text items.


You can also specify a different model to use for the completions. The `sendCompletion` method uses the `text-davinci-003` model by default.

```swift
openAPI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji", model: .gpt3(.ada)) { result in // Result<OpenAI, OpenAIError>
    // switch on result to get the response or error
}
```
For a full list of the supported models see [OpenAIModelType.swift](https://github.com/Nirj2004/AISWIFTPACKAGEMANAGER/blob/main/Sources/OpenAISwift/Models/OpenAIModelType.swift). For more information on the models see the [OpenAI API Documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models).

OpenAISwift also supports Swift concurrency so you can use Swift‚Äôs async/await syntax to fetch completions.

```swift
do {
	let result = try await openAPI.sendCompletion(with: "A random emoji")
} catch {
	print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```
